## Installation

You need to check if there is a package.json installed in your terminal. If there isn't enter npm init and then npm install inquirer@8.2.4. If there is already a package.json skip to installing inquirer with npm install inquirer@8.2.4. Once you have inquirer installed check to make sure the dependencies are there. If they are you're all set, but if not you'll need to use npm install to get them. Then you can use the readme generator!
